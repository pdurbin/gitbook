# Moving from local R-Studio to Sid R-Studio

## Upload to Drive 

Google Drive's web interface provides several ways to [upload local files to their storage service](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2424368?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), including drag and drop, file chooser, or using their sync app.

Alternatively, Google provides [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) to sync your local files to your Google drive.
