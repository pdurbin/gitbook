# FAQ

## What is my Sid username and password?

Your Sid credentials are your [HarvardKey](https://key.harvard.edu) username and password.

## Can I FTP files between Sid and my local computer using FileZilla or some other FTP program?

No.  Please use [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) to transfer data into and out of your Sid session.

## How do I run a batch job?

Sid will support batch jobs in a [future release](https://github.com/hmdc/sid/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen++batch).

## How do I read a network file in R?

Use the [`httr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/httr/versions/1.4.1) [`GET`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/httr/versions/1.4.1/topics/GET) function, e.g.,

```r
library(httr)

# Example World Health data
url <- 'https://pastebin.com/raw/V7DEMiDu';
r <- GET(url)
fil <- tempfile("data")
write(content(r, "text"), fil)
WHS_data <- read.table(fil, sep="\t", header=TRUE, quote="")

summary(WHS_data[,c(1,4,10)])
pairs(WHS_data[,c(1,4,10)])
```

## How much \[ephemeral\] storage does my job have?

Use [`df`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/df) `-h` to display disk size. E.g., in the below example, the job has `92G` of disk storage under `Avail`.

```text
$ df -h $HOME
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
overlay         105G   14G   92G  14% /
```
