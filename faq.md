# FAQ

## What is my Sid username and password?

Your Sid credentials are your [HarvardKey](https://key.harvard.edu) e-mail address and password.

## Can I FTP files between Sid and my local computer using FileZilla or some other FTP program?

No.  Please use [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) to transfer data into and out of your Sid session.

## How do I run a batch job?

Sid will support [classical batch-style processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing) in a [future release](https://github.com/hmdc/sid/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen++batch).  Currently, batch-style jobs can run indefinitely in the background _without user input_ within an [interactive job](https://www.sid.hmdc.harvard.edu/vmSelectDedicated).

## How do I read a network file in R?

Use the [`httr`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/httr/versions/1.4.1) [`GET`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/httr/versions/1.4.1/topics/GET) function, e.g.,

```
library(httr)

# Example World Health data
url <- 'https://pastebin.com/raw/V7DEMiDu';
r <- GET(url)
fil <- tempfile("data")
write(content(r, "text"), fil)
WHS_data <- read.table(fil, sep="\t", header=TRUE, quote="")

summary(WHS_data[,c(1,4,10)])
pairs(WHS_data[,c(1,4,10)])
```

## How much \[ephemeral\] storage does my job have?

Use [`df`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/df) `-h` to display disk size. E.g., in the below example, the job has `92G` of disk storage under `Avail`.

```
$ df -h $HOME
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
overlay         105G   14G   92G  14% /
```

## How do I cut and paste to and from my Sid Desktop?

Select `Site Settings`in your Sid Desktop browser tab:

![Site settings in Google Chrome browser](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-11-05-at-12.50.21-pm.png)

Select `Clipboard` -&gt; `Allow`

![Clipboard settings: Ask, Allow, and Block](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2019-11-05-at-11.18.57-am.png)

Different operating systems and keyboard configurations map copy and paste differently; but it is generally one of Ctrl-C, Option-C, Alt-C, or ⌘-C for copy \(and Ctrl-V, Option-V, Alt-V, or ⌘-V for paste\).

## How do I connect my Google Drive to my Sid Job?

In the [job launcher](https://www.sid.hmdc.harvard.edu/vmSelectDedicated), select `Google Drive` under `Connected Storage`:

See [this screencast](https://d.pr/v/adp0tJ) for a demonstration of attaching a Google Drive to a Sid job.

## Will requesting more resources slow my job's performance?

No.  A CPU is a CPU and RAM is RAM.  Sid does not allocate _cheaper_, worse-performing hardware based on request size.  Additionally, running multiple jobs will not degrade performance.  Sid users can run up to eleven jobs without any performance degradation \(as each is allocated dedicated resources from AWS\).

## How do I launch an app from the Sid Dashboard?

When Sid has completed provisioning your desktop environment, a link to it will appear below `Access Url` in the dashboard:
